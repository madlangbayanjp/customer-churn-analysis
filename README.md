📊 Customer Churn Analysis (Excel)
📌 Overview

This project analyzes customer churn data using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to identify patterns in customer behavior, understand which factors drive churn, and present findings through an interactive Excel dashboard.

Unlike traditional coding approaches, this analysis was performed entirely in Excel using PivotTables, charts, conditional formatting, and slicers.

🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains customer demographics, account details, and subscription information. Example fields:

CustomerID – Unique customer identifier

Demographics – Age, gender, location

Account Information – Tenure, contract type, monthly charges

Services – Internet, phone, streaming, tech support

Churn – Target variable (Yes/No)

🔍 Methodology

Data Cleaning → Removed duplicates, handled missing values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Used PivotTables to explore churn patterns

Visualization → Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and KPIs

Dashboard Creation → Combined results into a single interactive view with slicers
